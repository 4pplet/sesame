### To build the case you need:
|Count|Part|
|-|-|
|1|[Bottom plate](sheet-bottom.dxf)|
|2|[Bottom frame witout USB cutout](sheet-frame-bottom.dxf)|
|2|[Bottom frame with USB cutout](sheet-frame-bottom-usb.dxf)|
|1|[Switchplate](sheet-plate.dxf)|
|2|[Top frame](sheet-frame-top.dxf)|
|1|[Top plate](sheet-top.dxf)|
|6|[Feet plates](feet.dxf)|

The case is screwed together using M2 screws and nuts.

The case angle can be adjusted by the number of feet plates you attach to it.<br>
With six plates you will get roughly six degrees of typing angle.

Note: This has not been tested so far and is purely a concept.<br>
If you want to make this case the risk is entirely up to you. I do not guarantee that it works or fits.
